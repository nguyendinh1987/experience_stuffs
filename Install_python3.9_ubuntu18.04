Step 1: Install the dependencies required to build the Python package.  
  > sudo apt install build-essential zlib1g-dev \
  > libncurses5-dev libgdbm-dev libnss3-dev \
  > libssl-dev libreadline-dev libffi-dev curl software-properties-common
Step 2: Download the version tar package and extract it  
Step 3: Move to the extracted folder and run configuration  
Step 4: Install Python 3.9 alongside your current Python installation (if any)
Step 5: Verify your installation
Step 6: Make the installed python as the default version in the system (Optional):  
  - Using symbolic link mapping the installed python executive file to the default command. Syntax of the command creating symbolic link: ln -s path/to/executable_file path/to/default_command
  - Using alias: create an alias in ~/.bashrc file. For example, ```alias python3='/usr/bin/python3.9'```
